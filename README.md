# Express Template
Express template for new projects. This uses node-sass, autoprefixer, uglify, imagemin and tape.

As soon as you clone, make sure you perform the following actions:

1. Edit package.json
  1. Add a project name and a description
  2. Change your repository and bugs URLs
  3. Add some keywords
2. Uncomment the line ".eslintrc" in .gitignore
3. Change the title in routes/index.js
4. Run
``` bash
npm install
```

Now you're ready to go.
